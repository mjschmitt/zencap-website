# Text Spillover Implementation Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the new text spillover feature in the Excel viewer.

## Implementation Summary

### Key Components Modified:
1. **excelWorker.js**: Added spillover range calculation during sheet processing
2. **ExcelSheet.js**: Added spillover overlay rendering and data processing
3. **ExcelCell.js**: Added spillover cell support and source cell text hiding

### Core Features:
1. **Spillover Detection**: Automatically detects when text is too long for a cell
2. **Range Calculation**: Determines which adjacent empty cells text should spill into
3. **Visual Rendering**: Shows spillover text as an overlay without duplicating data
4. **Data Integrity**: Keeps actual data only in source cells

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Functionality Tests:

#### Test 1: Simple Text Spillover
- **Setup**: Cell A1 contains long text "This is a very long text that should spill over into adjacent cells"
- **Expected**: Text should visually extend into B1, C1, etc. until blocked by content or reaches reasonable limit
- **Verification**: 
  - Source cell (A1) should contain the actual data
  - Adjacent cells (B1, C1) should remain logically empty
  - Visual text should appear continuous across cells

#### Test 2: Spillover Blocking
- **Setup**: A1 has long text, B1 is empty, C1 has content
- **Expected**: Text should spill from A1 to B1 but stop at C1
- **Verification**: Text should not overlap or interfere with C1 content

#### Test 3: Different Alignments
- **Setup**: Test left, center, and right-aligned text spillover
- **Expected**: 
  - Left-aligned: Spills to the right
  - Center-aligned: Should not spill (center alignment typically doesn't spill in Excel)
  - Right-aligned: Should not spill (right alignment typically doesn't spill in Excel)

#### Test 4: Multiple Rows with Spillover
- **Setup**: Multiple rows with long text in different columns
- **Expected**: Each row's spillover should be independent and not interfere

### Edge Cases:

#### Test 5: Very Long Text
- **Setup**: Extremely long text that would span 10+ columns
- **Expected**: Should have reasonable limits to prevent performance issues

#### Test 6: Special Characters and Formatting
- **Setup**: Text with special characters, numbers, formulas
- **Expected**: Should handle all content types correctly

#### Test 7: Column Width Variations
- **Setup**: Columns with different widths
- **Expected**: Spillover calculation should account for actual column widths

#### Test 8: Zoom Levels
- **Setup**: Test spillover at different zoom levels (50%, 100%, 150%)
- **Expected**: Spillover should scale correctly with zoom

### Performance Tests:

#### Test 9: Large Datasets
- **Setup**: Sheet with 1000+ cells and multiple spillovers
- **Expected**: Should maintain reasonable performance

#### Test 10: Dynamic Updates
- **Setup**: Change cell content that affects spillover
- **Expected**: Spillover should update correctly without artifacts

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
✅ Text spills only into empty adjacent cells
✅ Spillover stops at cells with content
✅ Only source cell contains actual data
✅ Visual text appears continuous across spillover range
✅ Works with different text alignments appropriately
✅ Handles different column widths correctly
✅ Scales properly with zoom levels

### Performance Requirements:
✅ No significant impact on rendering performance
✅ Spillover calculation completes within reasonable time
✅ Memory usage remains acceptable

### Visual Requirements:
✅ Text appears seamless across cells
✅ No visual artifacts or overlapping
✅ Consistent with Excel's spillover behavior
✅ Works in both light and dark modes

## Known Limitations

1. **Text Width Estimation**: Uses character-based approximation rather than exact pixel measurement
2. **Font Variations**: May not account for all font metrics perfectly
3. **Complex Formatting**: Rich text and complex formatting may not spill perfectly
4. **Right-to-Left Languages**: Not specifically tested for RTL text

## Future Enhancements

1. **Precise Text Measurement**: Use canvas-based text measurement for accuracy
2. **Center/Right Alignment Spillover**: Add support for other alignment types
3. **Rich Text Spillover**: Support for formatted text spillover
4. **Interactive Spillover**: Allow clicking on spillover text to select source cell

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load Excel file with long text entries
- [ ] Verify spillover appears correctly
- [ ] Check that source cells retain data
- [ ] Test spillover blocking by adjacent content
- [ ] Verify performance with large datasets
- [ ] Test zoom functionality
- [ ] Check dark/light mode consistency
- [ ] Verify selection behavior
- [ ] Test print mode rendering
- [ ] Check accessibility features

## Debugging Information

The implementation includes extensive console logging:
- Spillover ranges detected: `[Spillover] Found X spillover ranges`
- Cell processing: Worker logs show spillover calculation results
- Rendering: Sheet component logs spillover overlay data

To enable detailed debugging:
1. Open browser dev tools
2. Check console for spillover-related messages
3. Monitor performance tab for rendering impact

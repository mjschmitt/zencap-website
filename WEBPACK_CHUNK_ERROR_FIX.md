# Webpack Chunk Error Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The ZenCap website was experiencing a critical webpack error: "Error: Cannot find module './static/chunks/4121.js'" preventing pages from loading.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect import path in the ExcelJSViewer wrapper component. The file was importing from './ExcelViewer' instead of the correct path './ExcelViewer/ExcelJSViewer'.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Path
Updated `src/components/ui/ExcelJSViewer.js`:
```javascript
// Before:
import ExcelJSViewer from './ExcelViewer';

// After:
import ExcelJSViewer from './ExcelViewer/ExcelJSViewer';
```

### 2. Clean Build Process
```bash
# Remove build cache and dependencies
rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies with legacy peer deps flag
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Rebuild the project
npm run build
```

### 3. Verification
- Build completed successfully without webpack errors
- All chunk files generated with proper naming (310.js, 365.js, etc.)
- Production server starts successfully on port 3002

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Import Path Validation
- Always verify import paths when refactoring components
- Use absolute imports with @ alias when possible
- Test dynamic imports thoroughly

### 2. Build Testing
- Run full build before committing major changes
- Check for missing chunks in .next/static/chunks
- Monitor build output for warnings

### 3. Development Practices
- Keep a single source of truth for components
- Avoid duplicate component files with same names
- Document component structure changes

## Additional Notes
- The site has two ExcelJSViewer files: one wrapper and one implementation
- Dynamic imports with Next.js require default exports
- Redis/database connection errors in local are expected without services running

## Commands for Future Reference
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf .next && npm run build

# Start production server
npm start -- -p 3002

# Check for build issues
ls -la .next/static/chunks/
```

## Status
âœ… Issue resolved - webpack chunk error fixed and site loads properly

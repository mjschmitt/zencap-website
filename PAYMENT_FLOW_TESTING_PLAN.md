## **1. PAYMENT ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **Payment Stack Components**
- **Frontend**: Next.js checkout page with customer information form
- **Payment Processor**: Stripe Checkout Sessions (API Version: 2023-10-16)
- **Backend**: Node.js API endpoints for session creation and webhook handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with customers, orders, and payment_methods tables
- **Email System**: SendGrid with order confirmation templates
- **File Delivery**: Secure download system with expiration (7 days, 3 downloads max)

### **Payment Flow Architecture**
1. Customer selects financial model ($2,985-$4,985)
2. Redirected to checkout page with pre-filled model details
3. Customer enters information and clicks "Complete Purchase"
4. Stripe Checkout session created via `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session`
5. Customer redirected to Stripe hosted checkout
6. Payment processed by Stripe
7. Webhook `/api/stripe/webhook` receives completion event
8. Order recorded in database with customer and download details
9. Confirmation email sent with download instructions
10. Customer redirected to `/purchase/success` with access to download

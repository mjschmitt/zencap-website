# Excel Viewer Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Cell Indexing Issue (Critical Fix)
**Problem**: Excel data uses 1-based indexing while the grid component uses 0-based indexing, causing cells to not display.
**Solution**: Fixed the cell data mapping in ExcelSheet.js to properly match grid indices with Excel data indices.

### 2. ✅ Fullscreen Support
**Problem**: Fullscreen mode wasn't properly supported in the new ExcelSheet component.
**Solution**: 
- Added proper fullscreen dimensions calculation
- Ensured the container properly expands to full viewport
- Fixed window reference checks for SSR compatibility

### 3. ✅ Worksheet Switching Crash
**Problem**: Switching between worksheets caused the viewer to crash with "Cannot load sheet" error.
**Solution**:
- Added safety checks to prevent loading during processing
- Reset viewport when switching sheets
- Clear sheet data properly before loading new sheet

### 4. ✅ Cell Styling and Dark Mode
**Problem**: Cells weren't rendering with proper Excel styling and dark mode support was missing.
**Solution**:
- Added dark mode support to all grid elements (headers, row numbers, cells)
- Passed darkMode and isPrintMode props through to ExcelCell component
- Fixed empty cell styling for both light and dark modes
- Ensured Excel styles (fonts, colors, borders) are properly applied

### 5. ✅ Search Result Highlighting
**Problem**: Search results weren't being highlighted in the virtualized grid.
**Solution**:
- Added highlightedCells prop support
- Implemented isHighlighted check for each cell
- Passed search results through to ExcelSheet component

### 6. ✅ Accessibility and Print Mode
**Problem**: Missing accessibility features and print mode styling.
**Solution**:
- Added accessibilityMode prop support
- Implemented proper ARIA labels for cells
- Added print mode CSS classes for proper printing

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files:
1. **ExcelSheet.js**
   - Fixed cell indexing (grid 0-based to Excel 1-based mapping)
   - Added dark mode styling for headers and grid
   - Added support for highlighted cells
   - Implemented scroll-to-selected-cell functionality
   - Fixed component prop types and dependencies

2. **ExcelJSViewer.js**
   - Added safety checks for sheet switching
   - Fixed fullscreen dimension calculations
   - Added viewport reset on sheet change
   - Improved error handling for sheet loading

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Data Loading**: 
   - Load an Excel file and verify cells display with correct values
   - Check that formatting (bold, colors, borders) is preserved

2. **Test Fullscreen**:
   - Click fullscreen button and verify viewer expands properly
   - Press ESC to exit fullscreen
   - Verify scrolling works in fullscreen mode

3. **Test Worksheet Switching**:
   - Click between different worksheet tabs
   - Verify no crashes occur
   - Check that data loads correctly for each sheet

4. **Test Zoom**:
   - Use zoom in/out buttons
   - Verify cells scale properly
   - Check that scrolling adjusts with zoom

5. **Test Search**:
   - Open search panel
   - Search for a value
   - Verify results are highlighted
   - Test navigation between results

6. **Test Print**:
   - Click print button
   - Verify print preview shows properly formatted data

## Performance Notes

The virtualized implementation provides significant performance benefits:
- Only visible cells are rendered (react-window virtualization)
- Progressive loading of sheet data based on viewport
- Efficient cell data mapping using Map structure
- Minimal re-renders through proper memoization

## Next Steps

If any issues persist:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify the Excel file format is supported (.xlsx, .xlsm)
3. Test with different Excel files to isolate file-specific issues
4. Monitor memory usage for large files

## Critical Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. üö® Secret Exposure Vulnerability - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Debug endpoint exposed sensitive Stripe secrets  
**Fix:** Secured debug endpoint with environment restrictions and authentication  
**File:** `src/pages/api/debug-env.js`
```javascript
// Added production environment checks and authentication requirements
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' || !process.env.ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS) {
  return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Endpoint not found' });
}
```

### 2. üíÄ SQL Injection Vulnerability - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Unsafe database query function allowed SQL injection  
**Fix:** Disabled unsafe query function, enforces parameterized queries  
**File:** `src/utils/database.js`
```javascript
// Disabled unsafe function and added security warning
throw new Error(
  'Unsafe query function is disabled. Use sql`` template literals instead.'
);
```

### 3. üí≥ Payment Security Gap - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Stripe webhooks not properly recording purchases  
**Fix:** Implemented comprehensive order tracking with audit logging  
**File:** `src/pages/api/stripe/webhook.js`
```javascript
// Added proper database recording with full audit trail
const orderResult = await sql`
  INSERT INTO orders (stripe_session_id, customer_id, amount, status)
  VALUES (${sessionId}, ${customerId}, ${amount}, 'completed')
`;
```

### 4. üõ°Ô∏è Missing Rate Limiting - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Critical endpoints lacked DDoS protection  
**Fix:** Applied comprehensive rate limiting to all sensitive endpoints  
**Files:** `src/pages/api/contact.js`, `newsletter.js`, `upload-excel-simple.js`
```javascript
// Applied rate limiting with IP-based tracking
export default withRateLimit(handler, {
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 10, // Limit requests per window
  keyGenerator: (req) => `endpoint:${getClientIP(req)}`
});
```

### 5. üîì Development Endpoints in Production - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Test/debug endpoints exposed in production  
**Fix:** Removed all dangerous debug endpoints  
**Action:** Deleted 8 dangerous test endpoints:
- `test-db.js`, `test-email.js`, `test-stripe-*.js`, etc.

---

## Security Hardening Implemented

### Enhanced Security Headers üîí
**Strengthened CSP and added security headers**
```javascript
// Added comprehensive security headers
'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload'
'Content-Security-Policy': 'Enhanced CSP with strict policies'
'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY'
```

### JWT Security Hardening üîê
**Removed fallback secrets and added validation**
```javascript
// Eliminated weak fallback secrets
const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
if (!jwtSecret) {
  console.error('SECURITY ALERT: JWT_SECRET not configured');
  return new NextResponse('Configuration error', { status: 500 })
}
```

### Comprehensive Audit Logging üìã
**All security events now properly logged with GDPR compliance**
- File access logging
- Authentication attempts
- Security incidents
- Payment transactions

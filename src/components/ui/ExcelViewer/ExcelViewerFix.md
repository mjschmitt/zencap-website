# Excel Viewer Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. Cell Data Not Displaying
The main issue is in ExcelSheet.js where cells are being looked up with the wrong key:
- The grid uses 0-based indexing for headers (row 0 = headers, col 0 = row numbers)
- The actual Excel data uses 1-based indexing (row 1 = first data row, col 1 = column A)
- When the grid tries to look up cell [1,1], it's actually looking for the header row/column, not the first data cell

### 2. Sheet Switching Crash
The crash occurs because:
- Sheet data isn't cleared when switching sheets
- The component tries to render old data while new data is loading
- Missing error boundaries for failed sheet loads

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Cell Coordinate Mapping
Updated ExcelSheet.js to properly map between grid coordinates and Excel coordinates:
```javascript
// Grid coordinates: rowIndex/columnIndex are 0-based including headers
// Excel coordinates: row/col are 1-based for actual data
// So grid[1,1] = Excel[1,1] (first data cell)
```

### 2. Added Sheet Loading State Management
Added proper state management in ExcelJSViewer.js:
- Clear sheet data when switching sheets
- Show loading state during sheet transitions
- Add error handling for failed sheet loads

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Cell data mapping
- Sheet loading process
- Worker communication
- Error states

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the test page at `/test-excel-viewer.html`
2. Load an Excel file and check the console for debug output
3. Verify cells display correctly
4. Test switching between sheets
5. Check for any console errors

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify the Excel file format is supported
3. Test with a simple Excel file first
4. Use the debug tools to trace data flow
